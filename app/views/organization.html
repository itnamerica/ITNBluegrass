              <p>Having worked with senior citizens for the past eighteen years, she has learned that one of the most dire needs for seniors to remain independent is transportation.

In 1987, he became the program director of the associate of applied science degree program in nuclear medicine technology at Lexington Community College (now Bluegrass Community and Technical College).  Teaching and community service were the emphases at the community college rather than research, so he has spent time volunteering not only for professional societies but also for local groups such as Ronald McDonald House, A Moveable Feast, and ITNB in the past 30 years.  He is also very involved at St Michael's Episcopal Church having served on the vestry (board), nominating committee for clergy, sabbatical planning committee, and choir among other groups in the church.</p>

Charles who teaches math at Elizabethtown Community and Technical College, and Robert who is the current chaplain at St Augustine's Chapel on UK's campus for the Episcopal/Lutheran Ministry.

              <p>In 2017, Charles retired from BCTC, and he now works as a nuclear medicine technologist again 1 1/2 days/week at Lexington Diagnostic Center and Open MRI.  The remainder of his time is devoted to A Moveable Feast, ITNB, St Michael's and his grandchildren.  He also enjoy traveling with a friend from Chicago.  They just returned from a tour of Morocco, and last year traveled to England on the Queen Mary 2 and spent about 10 days traveling on the trains and buses to see some of the great cathedrals and hear the choirs in Bristol, Cardiff (Wales), Coventry, Lincoln, York, Durham, and Edinburgh (Scotland).</p>

                <h2>The Power of Technology</h2>
                <p>Our proprietary ITNRides™ software system enables us to leverage our expertise and to simplify operations for all our affiliates.</p>

                <p>It connects every ITN affiliate community into one effective centralized national network that manages the logistics of the senior transportation service, including member and volunteer management and ride scheduling.</p>

                <p>All ITN affiliates access the software through an internet connection and store their information at our secure data center. The collected data is used for a variety of purposes; including helping social researchers better understand senior mobility and its effects on society. ITN technology provides everything needed to deliver logistical efficiency to a very complex problem.</p>

                <p>ITN is quickly linking cities and citizens across the country and that's just the beginning. Soon, ITN will grow beyond the cities and suburbs to the small towns and rural communities where the unmet need is so great. Our goal is to provide the expertise, tools and state-of-the-art technology that will allow small organizations to serve more and more people without additional resources or funds. We call this project ITNEverywhere</p>
